/*  Program: Hashing
 *	Author: Daniel Zelfo
 *	Class: CSCI 230
 *	Date: 3/23/2020
 *	Description: This program is made up of three different hash table classes, which use three diferent hashing schemes: Chain Hashing, Linear Probe Hashing, and Double Hashing
 *				 Each class can be constructed using an input file and can take a load factor to use
 *				 The hash tables the Hasher class to generate a hash code for any given key
 *				 Each record is stored in an Entry
 *				 The user can search, insert, and erase records in O(1) using these hash tables
 *
 *
 I certify that the code below is my own work.

 *	Exception(s): N/A
