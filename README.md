# List Data Structure
C++ List Data Structure and Sequence Data Structure

This program implements a List. functions include inserting and erasing at any given position
the list was essentially a doubly linked list
positions are obtained by the itertator class
I also implemented a sequence with the functions indexOf and atIndex
