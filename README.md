# AdjacencyMatrix
C++ Adjacency Matrix Graph Program

This program includes the AdjacencyMatrixGraph class, which is a list representation of an undirected graph
The AdjacencyMatrixGraph class can insert vertices and edges, remove vertices and edges, print a graph, and more
The AdjacencyMatrixGraph class inherits from the Graph class, and it includes the classes InnerVertex and InnerEdge, which respectively inherit from Vertex and Edge
The AdjacencyMatrixGraph class has a constructor that takes a boolean value for whether or not the graph is directed
