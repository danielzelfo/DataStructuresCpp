# StandardTrie
C++ StandardTrie Program

This program includes a StandardTrie class, which can construct a standard trie using a text file
The constructor of the StandardTrie class reads each word in the text file, ignoring any characters that aren't letter
Each character of the word being inserted into the standard trie is checked to see if it is the child of the current node
The StandardTrie class has an includes function which can be used to check whether or not a given word is in the standard trie. It returns an integer for the number of occurrences of the word in the text.
