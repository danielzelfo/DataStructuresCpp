/*  Program: Standard Trie (WITH EXTRA CREDIT)
 *	Author: Daniel Zelfo
 *	Class: CSCI 230
 *	Date: 5/11/2020
 *	Description: This program includes a StandardTrie class, which can construct a standard trie using a text file.
 *               The constructor of the StandardTrie class reads each word in the text file, ignoring any characters that aren't letters.
 *               Each character of the word being inserted into the standard trie is checked to see if it is the child of the current node.
 *               The StandardTrie class has an includes function which can be used to check whether or not a given word is in the standard trie.
 *				 V1.1: It returns an integer for the number of occurrences of the word in the text.
 *
 * I certify that the code below is my own work.
 *
 *	Exception(s): N/A
