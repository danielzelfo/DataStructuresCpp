/*  Program: List v1.1

Description: 
			This program implements a List. The functions include insert and erase at any given position.
			The list is essentially a doubly linked list, and its positions are obtained by the Iterator class.
			v1.1: I also implemented a Sequence with the functions indexOf and atIndex.

I certify that the code below is my own work.

Exception(s): N/A
